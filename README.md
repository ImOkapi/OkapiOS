# OkapiOS
This is the repository of the operating system OkapiOS.

# What is OkapiOS?
Okapi is a 32-bit CLI operating system made in C and ASM.
Okapi was made to be a full-out CLI OS, with functionality greater than other operating systems.

# How do I run it?
You can download an IMG/ISO file of Okapi, then run it on QEMU (Quick EMUlator).

# I found a problem
If, in any case, you happen to find a problem with the system, please report it to us or email us at okapisupport@gmail.com

# Can I contribute?
We are more than happy to get feedback from users of the system, but this is a privately built open-source project. We may consider help in the future.
