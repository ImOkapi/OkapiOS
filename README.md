# V1 still in making! We will update this as soon as possible!
# OkapiOS
This is the repository of the operating system OkapiOS.

# What is OkapiOS?
Okapi is a 32-bit CLI operating system made in C and ASM. Its a pretty generic operating system, But we will soon make Okapi a OS with GUI.

OkapiOS was inspired by the infamous tutorial from **cfenollosa**: os-tutorial. (https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)

We also got help from a youtube video which we can NOT thank ENOUGH! 'Build a 32-bit CLI OS from scratch!' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

# How do I run it?
You can download an IMG/ISO file of Okapi, then run it on QEMU (Quick EMUlator).

# I found a problem
If, in any case, you happen to find a problem with the system, please report it to us or email us at okapihelp@gmail.com (We may take 4-5 buisness days to respond. Please be considerateðŸ˜Š.)

# Can I contribute?
We are more than happy to get feedback from users of the system, but this is a privately built open-source project. We may consider help in the future.
